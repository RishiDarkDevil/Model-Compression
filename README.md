# Model Compression
Here I discuss Neural Network Compression using two quite popular methods:
- Singular Value Decomposition
- Weight Pruning

### Frameworks
I used two new frameworks for this work:
- Jax
- Haiku

### Notebooks
The entire work is elaborated and implemented in `NN_Model_Compression.ipynb` notebook
